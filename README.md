Tasks in which I implemented Assembly translator.

Task 1: given a string in hexadecimal and a set of codification rules, I had to print the correct assembly instruction. Rules are found in the Assembly-Translator.pdf file.

Task 2: given an assembly calculus instruction, I had to print the calculus' correct result.

For example :
-- input : 2 10 mul 5 div 7 6 sub add
-- output : 5
